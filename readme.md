#Textbook

Textbook is a simple content management system for textbook-like sites. It organizes content into pages, which are grouped into sections. A table of contents lists all of the sections, and each section index lists the pages in the section. At the bottom of each page are navigation links to the next and previous pages, as well as to the section index and the table of contents.

To create new sections and pages, a user must be signed in and have the `author` attribute set to `true`. This attribute can only be set from the console. If an author deletes a page or section, the content is maintained in the database via the [Paranoia](https://github.com/radar/paranoia) gem to allow recovery from accidental deletions.

The first page of the first section is used as the homepage. If no pages exist yet, a placeholder page is displayed. The code for this logic could probably use some love.

The site title must be set in code in application.html.erb.

Pull requests are welcome :)


##To do

* As a user, the URL I see for each page should be the section or page name, not the ID number, so that the link to each page is more descriptive.
* As a student, each page should show me how far along I am in the section, so that I know how much I've done and how much is left.
* As a student, if I am signed in and visit the homepage, I should be redirected to the last page I visited, so that I don't have to bookmark or navigate back where I am each time I leave and come back.
* As an author, I should be able to drag and drop pages, sections, and chapters to change their order.
* As an author, I should be able to put some or all of my content behind a paywall, so that I require users to pay me for the work I did to make my site.
* As an author, I should be able to put the sign in/sign up links and navigation links in a different place on the homepage, so that I can have a marketing site as my homepage while the rest of the content is more textbook-style.
* As an author, I should be able to un-delete my content from the user interface, so that I don't have to use the console if I need to un-delete something.
* As an author, I should be able to restore a previous version of a page, so that I can see what changes I've made over time and undo accidental changes.
* As a student, I should be able to give feedback on a page, so that I can point out if something isn't clear or tell the authors how much I like what they've written.
* As an author, I should be able to provide custom CSS for my site, so that I can give it a unique look and feel. The current CSS is [Bootswatch Simplex](http://bootswatch.com/simplex/), built on [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).
* As a user, I should be able to view the site on screens of different sizes without horizontal scrolling, so that I can visit it on a tablet, phone, or computer with a small screen. (Use bootstrap-responsive!)
* As an author, I should be able to change the site title, so that I don't have to edit code and re-deploy to make that change.
* As a user, I should see a bottom nav bar on every page, so that I always have navigation links to where I might want to go.
